# Data_Science
Successfully completed the course in my second semester of Master's Program in Computer Science at Old Dominion University.  

The course work comprised of weekly assigments, mid-term exam and a project. This course introduced me to numpy, pandas, seaborn, Bokeh and several
graph plotting and visualizing concepts for data sets. Also it taught me several Data Exploration and Analysis concepts with 
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-NN, K-means and Naive-Bayes.  

This was tested with my Project work where I used the data set from [Kaggle-UK Traffic Accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales)
to visualize the data and implement data exploration techniques to predict casualties.
